This rice isn’t your everyday rice, it has special properties that make it super sticky, which is the key to the perfect mochi! History buffs haven’t narrowed the exact time when these sticky rice cakes were created, but they’ve found steamers associated with them that are as old as the Kofun Period (super old!). In Japan during new years, folks will display a decoration called Kagami Mochi which contains a large rice cake at the base, a smaller one above, topped with a daidai fruit. Mochi also has many other influences in Asian culture, it’s certainly a good read for all foodies out there!
